# Tutorial: Adding Three Numbers Using `my_adder`

## Objective
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `my_adder` function to add three numbers and return the result.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Define the numbers you want to add
Start by deciding on three numbers. These numbers can be any valid numerical values in Python (integers, floats, etc.). For this example, letâ€™s choose `a = 5.5`, `b = 10.1`, and `c = 15.9`.

```python
a = 5.5
b = 10.1
c = 15.9
```

### Step 2: Call the `my_adder` function
Next, you will pass the three numbers you defined to the `my_adder` function. The function will return the sum of these numbers.

```python
result = my_adder(a, b, c)
```

### Step 3: Print the results
Finally, display the result of the addition to the console using the `print()` function.
```python
print(f'The sum of {a}, {b}, and {c} is {result}')
```
