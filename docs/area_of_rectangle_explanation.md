# Explanation: Calculating the Area of a Rectangle with `area_of_rectangle`

**What Does the `area_of_rectangle` Function Do?**
This function calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its width and length. This is a straightforward application of the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Width × Length. The function is a basic example of how to create and use mathematical operations within a Python function.

We have two edge cases for this function:
- Zero Values: If either width or length is zero, the area will be zero.
- Negative Values: In most real-world scenarios, negative values for width or length don’t make sense. If passed, the function will still return a result, but it will be negative.

**Why Would You Use the `area_of_rectangle` Function?**
While adding three numbers seems trivial, this function has practical utility for:

- Code reuse: You avoid having to write the addition operation manually each time you need it.
- Scalability: In larger projects or programs, functions like this can serve as building blocks for more complex operations.
- Modularity: It encourages a clean separation of logic. Instead of having arithmetic operations scattered throughout your code, you can centralize the logic in a reusable function.
