# Explanation: Adding Three Numbers Using `my_adder`

**What Does the `my_adder` Function Do?**

The my_adder function performs a simple task: it takes three numerical values and returns their sum.

- Input: Three numbers are passed to the function as arguments (`a`, `b`, and `c`).
- Processing: The function uses the `+` operator to add these numbers.
- Output: The function returns the sum of the numbers as a single value.
This function helps in automating repetitive tasks like adding numbers, a common need in many mathematical and data analysis problems.

**Why Would You Use the `my_adder` Function?**

While adding three numbers seems trivial, this function has practical utility for:

- Code reuse: You avoid having to write the addition operation manually each time you need it.
- Scalability: In larger projects or programs, functions like this can serve as building blocks for more complex operations.
- Modularity: It encourages a clean separation of logic. Instead of having arithmetic operations scattered throughout your code, you can centralize the logic in a reusable function.
