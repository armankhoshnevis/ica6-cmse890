# Welcome to the Function Documentation

This website contains documentaions for each example function we wrote a test for.

Functions that are considered here are `my_adder`, `my_thermo_stat`, `have_digits`, `area_of_rectangle`, and `perimeter_of_rectangle`. For each function, a **tutorial**, a **how-to-guide**, a **reference**, and a **explanation** is provided.
