# Tutorial: Calculating the Perimeter of a Rectangle Using `perimeter_of_rectangle`

## Objective
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `perimeter_of_rectangle` function to calculate the area of a rectangle given its width and length.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Define the width and length
```python
width = 5
length = 10
```

### Step 2: Call the `perimeter_of_rectangle` function
```python
perimeter = perimeter_of_rectangle(width, length)
```

### Step 3: Print the result
```python
print(f'The perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter}')
```
