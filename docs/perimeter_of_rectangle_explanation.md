# Explanation: Calculating the Perimeter of a Rectangle with `perimeter_of_rectangle`

**What Does the `perimeter_of_rectangle` Function Do?**
This function calculates the perimeter of a rectangle by summing over its widths and lengths. This is a straightforward application of the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = 2 × (Width + Length). The function is a basic example of how to create and use mathematical operations within a Python function.

We have two edge cases for this function:
- Zero Values: If either of the dimensions are zero, it does not make geometrical sense.
- Negative Values: In most real-world scenarios, negative values for width or length don’t make sense. If passed, the function will still return a result.

**Why Would You Use the `area_of_rectangle` Function?**
While adding three numbers seems trivial, this function has practical utility for:

- Code reuse: You avoid having to write the addition operation manually each time you need it.
- Scalability: In larger projects or programs, functions like this can serve as building blocks for more complex operations.
- Modularity: It encourages a clean separation of logic. Instead of having arithmetic operations scattered throughout your code, you can centralize the logic in a reusable function.
