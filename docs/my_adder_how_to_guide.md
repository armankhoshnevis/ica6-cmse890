# How-to Guide: Adding Three Numbers Using `my_adder`

In this very concise how-to guide, I would like to emphasize on the fact that this function, `my_adder`, is compatible with integers, floats, negative, zero, and their combination as inputs.

Therefore, you can go ahead and set the parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` to any of the above combinations and see the results. See the tutorial of this function for a sample example.
